        The magic thing about Rails is when I looked at it
        the first time, I knew how it worked because I
        already knew Ruby really well. <br/> <br/>

        I saw all the metaprogramming tricks; they were
        almost transparent, looking at it.  But I
        didn't know you could put it together
        that way and create something so expressive and
        succinct. <br/><br/>

      <p>
        With Rebuilding Rails, you'll build an <i>MVC web framework</i>,
        structured like Rails and using the same underlying
        libraries and tricks.  You'll
        <u>learn the magic behind Rails</u>.
        You'll finish each system and solidify your knowledge
        with structured exercises.  And you'll understand Rails
        like only a framework builder can.

      <h2 class="big-division"> Future-Proof Mastery </h2>

      <p>
        When your upgraded controller and filter code raises
        yet another exception, it's because
        Rails changed under you.  When you apply a few tweaks
        you Googled and it's only mostly fixed, you <i>know</i>
        there's a better way.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can learn the fundamentals of <u>every Ruby web framework
        in a future-proof way</u>...  by learning <b>the layer that
        Rails is building on</b>.  To learn Rails the
        way the experts do, you'll have to
        learn Rack, Ruby's portable HTTP API.
      </p>

      <p>
        That's hard.  The Rack documentation is often
        wrong and frequently gives you only the name of a method or
        class, not what in the world it actually does.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rebuilding Rails will take you through building a <u>real,
        functional Rack framework</u>.  Building on Rack is the only
        way to really understand Rack.

      <p>
        You've spent hours tracing through before_filters and plugins.
        You've wondered why your controller variable isn't being passed
        through.  You've spent your share of days on five-minute bugs.
      </p>

      <p>
        You'll do better when you can <u>see more of what's underneath</u>.

      <p>
        But to do that, you can read a lot of source code...  Or

        that you can only get by <u>building it yourself</u>.

      <p>
        Every <a href="book_toc.html">chapter of Rebuilding Rails</a>
        is about building a
        system from Rails.  Models, controllers, database access,
        routing...

      <ul>
        <li> Gems, Gemfiles and Frameworks </li>
        <li> Controllers and Routing </li>
        <li> Automatic Class and File Loading </li>
        <li> Views and Templating </li>
        <li> Models from Files </li>
        <li> Requests and Responses </li>
        <li> ORMs and Database-Backed Models </li>
        <li> Advanced Rack for All Frameworks </li>
        <li> Advanced Routing </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Every chapter teaches you more Ruby magic, which makes
        Rails more transparent.

      <p>You should rebuild if:</p>

      <ul>
        <li> You're an intermediate Rails programmer
          and want to go deeper </li>
        <li> You want to contribute to Rails, but have
          no idea how it works </li>
        <li> You love to know how everything works </li>
        <li> You want to learn at your own pace, but
          blog posts are just too shallow </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Do <b>NOT</b> buy if:</p>

      <ul>
        <li> You're entirely new to Ruby </li>
        <li> You want an API guide, not structural rebuilding. </li>
        <li> You're a seriously advanced Rails programmer and
          already read the source code regularly </li>
        <li> The style in the sample chapters really doesn't
